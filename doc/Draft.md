Introduction
--------
Like many, I often have an idea for a program or an application, but when I then sit down to implement this awesome idea, then I stop.
The thing is I only have a **rough** idea and nothing tangible, which most likely led me to a bad end.

Let me try to explain what happened. So I then start to implement and soon after I come across concerns which have not been considered, yet. Even the simple question:*"What do I want to accomplish with this piece of code?"* gets harder to answer as I code along.

Finally, it happens. I am left with a hacked together code base with less then reliable functionality, missing documentation and no real usability whatsoever makes myself lose any motivation to follow through with my project/work/life .

This undefined piece of work is meant as to guide myself on this journey into the world of software development, hopefully obtaining vast knowledge along the way.

You are free to follow me on this journey and maybe we can share our gained wisdom afterwards. Now let's get going!

Chapter I
=========================
Preparing for the journey
-------------------------
Well this is awkward. Here I vow to myself to go on this odyssey treating it like a trip to the market. *"What happened"* you might ask. To this inquiry I will admit that I was careless. I am **not** prepared for this adventure. I want to start, but my mind is blank. Again, I can see a bottomless pit in front of me.

I have no clue where to start. Also I already forgot a significant amount of my ideas. I sense this ghastly feeling of my motivation fading away, and leaving behind only displeasure.

Therefore to not falter in the face of my own inability to advance, there is a need to plan for this trip.

First let's ask some questions about my objectives:

1. Where do I want to go.
2. What do I want to see.
3. What do I want to accomplish.
