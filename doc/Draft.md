Introduction
--------
Like many, I often have an idea for a program or an application, but when I then sit down to implement this awesome idea, then I stop.
The thing is I only have a **rough** idea and nothing tangible, which most likely led me to a bad end.

Let me try to explain what happened. So I then start to implement and soon after I come across concerns which have not been considered, yet. Even the simple question:*"What do I want to accomplish with this piece of code?"* gets harder to answer as I code along.

Finally, it happens. I am left with a hacked together code base with less then reliable functionality, missing documentation and no real usability whatsoever makes myself lose any motivation to follow through with my project/work/life .

This undefined piece of work is meant as to guide myself on this journey into the world of software development, hopefully obtaining vast knowledge along the way.

You are free to follow me on this journey and maybe we can share our gained wisdom afterwards. Now let's get going!

Chapter I
=========================
Preparing for the journey
-------------------------
I willcome you to this akward place. Here to go on this odyssey treating it like a trip to the market. *"What happened"* you might ask. To this inquiry I might anwser:*It was carelessness"* . Not beeing prepared, blank minds. An insurmountable wall appears right before ones eyes.

The Question:
> Where does one even begin?

Once great ideas already forgotten, a ghastly feeling of ones motivation fading away only to leave behind doubt. Therefore to not falter in the face of ones own inability to advance, there is a need to plan for this trip.

One needs to calm down and ponder about possible intentions one might have for going on any journey like this.

Then write them down. Bring those ideas into the physical space. Out of imaginary planes right into reality.

But what good can this course of action possibly do?
>It can help to bind, to direct, to remind. A thought written down is like a contract with oneself. It helps to not lose faith and to reflect upon the path which was taken.
